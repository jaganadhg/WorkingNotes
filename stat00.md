### Statistics

* Statistics can be defined as a collection of techniques used when planning a data collection, and when subsequently analysing and presenting data.

* Two kinds of statistics:
  - Descriptive Statistics
  - Analytical Statistics

* Descriptive Statistics means describing data using tables, charts and simple statistical calculations such as averages, percentages etc. 
* Analytics is used to asses difference and relationships in data.

* Survey - Population (a total survey) Sample ( a sample survey).

* Histogram shows the frequeny of the data values. 
  - The histogram should normally have 3-13 bars.
  - The more observations, the more bars

* Determine Number of bars = long(n)/log(2). Here n is the number of values and log is the logarithemic function. You can use logarithms of base 10 or natural logarithms; the result of the formula will be same. 

* Width of bar = (maximum value - minimum value_/number of bars. Round off is applicable

* Scatterplots are well suited to show relationships between two variables. 

* Line charts are often used to illustratea trend, where X-varibale is e.g., time, age or seniority.

* Bubble plot is a varient of the scatter plot. The size of each bubble represent the value fo a third variable.

* Tbale elements Title, Column Title, Row Title cells, footnote 

* Two types of data
  - Quantitative data: Thse data are used for calculations and for defining the axes in graphs.
  - Qualitative data: These data correspond to groupings of the sample, in table or graphs.

* source of variation
  - Systematic variation : The center of data
  - Random variation : The spread of data
