### Statistics

* Statistics can be defined as a collection of techniques used when planning a data collection, and when subsequently analysing and presenting data.

* Two kinds of statistics:
  - Descriptive Statistics
  - Analytical Statistics

* Descriptive Statistics means describing data using tables, charts and simple statistical calculations such as averages, percentages etc. 
* Analytics is used to asses difference and relationships in data.

* Survey - Population (a total survey) Sample ( a sample survey).

* Histogram shows the frequeny of the data values. 
  - The histogram should normally have 3-13 bars.
  - The more observations, the more bars

* Determine Number of bars = long(n)/log(2). Here n is the number of values and log is the logarithemic function. You can use logarithms of base 10 or natural logarithms; the result of the formula will be same. 

* Width of bar = (maximum value - minimum value_/number of bars. Round off is applicable

* Scatterplots are well suited to show relationships between two variables. 

* Line charts are often used to illustratea trend, where X-varibale is e.g., time, age or seniority.

* Bubble plot is a varient of the scatter plot. The size of each bubble represent the value fo a third variable.

* Tbale elements Title, Column Title, Row Title cells, footnote 

* Two types of data
  - Quantitative data: Thse data are used for calculations and for defining the axes in graphs.
  - Qualitative data: These data correspond to groupings of the sample, in table or graphs.

* source of variation
  - Systematic variation : The center of data
  - Random variation : The spread of data
  
* Mesure of location (center) mesure of dispersion (spread)

* Avegrage is a mesure of the center in the distribution of the data values. 
  - The average is calculated as the sum of all the data values divided by their number.
  - x-bar .
  - Often people use the term mean rather than average.
  - Avergae is highly influenced by 'extreme values'.

* The median is the data value "in the middle", i.e., a number that divided the data values in to two parts with an equal number of values. 
  - The median can be found by first sorting the data values in ascending order.
  - In the case of an odd number of data values, the median is the middle value.
  - In the case of an even number of data values, there is no single data value driving data values into two euqally large parts; we then define the median as the average of the two middle values.

* Themode is simply the most frequent data value.

   - For right-skewed distribution a data distribution with many large data values, the evarage is larger than median.
   - For a left-skewed distribution i.e., a distribution with many small data values, the average is snaller than the median.
   

* The range is simply the width of the intervel of the data values. 
    - R = x max - x min

* The variaence is the average of the squered distance between the data values and the average. 
    - V = Sum(xi-x-bar)2/n-1

* The standard deviation is the square root of the varience. 
    - sqrt(V)

* IQR = Q3 - Q1 
  - The lowr quartile (or first quartile) Q1 is a number that divided the data values into two prats so that one-fourth of the data values are smaller than the lower quartile, and three-fourths of the data values are larger.
  - The upper quartile (or third quartile) Q# is a figure that divided the data values into two parts so that three-fourths of the data values are smaller than the upper quartile and one-fourth of the data values are larger.


* Choice of mesure 
  - If the distribution is symmetrical average as mesure of location. Standard devision is mesure of dispersion .
  - If the distribution is skewed median as mesure of location . IQR as mesure of dispersion. 

* Dispersion or relative spread
  - Coefficeient of variation, often denoted CV, defined as the standard deviation as a percentage of average 
  - CV = s/x-bar $x$ 100%
  - Sometimes it called relative standard deviation


* Data Types
  * Quantitative Data e.g weight, height, temperature, amount 
      - Ratio Data
      - Interval data  (negatives can occour)
  * Qualitative Data e.g gender, education, occupation
      - Ordinal data - A number of categories with with natural ordering e.g grades in school
      - Nominal Data - A number of named categories e.g various types of fruits banana, pinapple, ornage
      - Binary Data - Two categiroes 
  * Integer Data - Counting data
